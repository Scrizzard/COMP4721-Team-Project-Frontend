MEETING NOTES - JANUARY 16, 2015

DESIGN IDEAS
- different inscriptions open up in different tabs
- which notification you click on opens a specific tab
- when opening app, either open up to the new inscription you've just passed, or the last one you've visited
- have a map, be able to see possible locations highlighted
	+ link to google map, potentially
	+ ability to get directions to other areas
	+ different colours for already visited places?
- Potential Options: help, settings, info, search? (for the future)
- emphasis on user control over their experience
	+ user may specify type of notifications, how many notifications/inscriptions, within each inscription ability to get extra notifications
- on each inscription page, either have a see map option, or just the inscription info
	+ potentially use Google maps for an embedded map, since it's available on most phones already
- there should be a difference between getting notified about passing an inscription and actually reading the page/visiting the site

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS/FURTHER DISCUSSION
- how do you actually make a map with things highlighted?
	+ is that a data or a front end issue?
	+ how do we connect from clicking on the map to a page in our app?
- multiple notifications: is there a way to delete redundant or previous notifications?
	+ open to the inscription for the specific notification they've clicked on?
	+ can we make a queue of notifications?
		> open up a new tab/view every time you get a new notification
		> one tab with "current" or closest inscription with focus (or an icon that indicates its status)
- what exactly should notifications constitute? 
			
TO DISCUSS WITH BACK-END TEAM
- data story, data structures we'll be dealing with
- what things we want to keep track of: number of notifications, change of inscription settings (max reminders, etc), 
	actually viewed notification vs. walked by but did not click notification
- set up preliminary calendar of events
- set up shared Github 
- communication scheme between groups
	+ shared notes, any other ideas?
	+ put meeting descriptions on communal Github
		
NEXT STEPS
- start playing around with screens
- designing help and settings pages
- look at geofencing code
- preliminary research on android app development

TEAM MEETING - JANUARY 19, 2015
- what does it look like when something's missing? (eg. translation)
- how much storage do we need to store our pictures, data, etc. 
	> stored on online database, or downloaded with app?
	> option to download different packet for different cities
- what is our data?
	FOR EACH INSCRIPTION (global, immmutable)
	> short, but descriptive name
	> inscription in original language
	> english translation of inscription
	> language of inscription
	> location 
		>> latitude, longitude, radius
	> text description/physical description of location
	> picture of location
	> historical data (date, author, other historical info)
	> difficulty of finding (easy, medium, hard)
		>> determined by researcher when they send us info about the location
	> unique key/serial number
	> city this inscription is found in
	ON PHONE/DEVICE (local, mutable)
	> data on preferences for each inscription/global preferences
	> seen or not seen
	> remind me later, or never (timestamp)
	> hidden/shown
	
		
- ability to search (by what?)
- back end is in charge of the GPS, sends a notification to the front end when a fence is encountered
- fetch one inscription at a time from the back end
	
- separation of concerns 
- front end requests to local database	
	> hide/show notifications for a site
	> don't show notifications for a site until timestap
	> set site status to seen/not seen

- questions for HW
	> do we want short name?
		>> if so, does it need translations?
	> multiple pictures?
	> local or hosted database?
	> how much storage do we need?
	> how should we plan for creation of additional cities?
	
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

GROUP MEETING - JANUARY 19, 2015

- inscription page
	> button to open up map showing location
	> option/button to set notification settings
- tabs down side, coloured tabs (not clicked, clicked, discovered) 
	> colouring matches map colours
- under corner menu item
	> list/home, map, serach, help, settings, info, list (all, found)
	> list form
- tutorial?
- is the map a back end issue?
- when map is opened, click on a location and SOME info pops up, as well as a button that brings user to inscription page
- on inscription page, a button to bring to the map with location highlighted

NEXT STEPS
- project requirements, specifications, test cases [split up work by role]
- group meeting to plan out goals and workflows [group]
	> split work flows between 3 members to design use cases
- prototype UI : design of each page [group]
	> on paper, or electronically (photoshop)
- meeting on Tuesday, Jan 20.: 1-230, Linux lab.

TO ASK DR. HW
- requirements vs. specifications document

/--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

GROUP MEETING - JANUARY 20, 2015

GOALS
- layouts for all screens : M1
- design notifications (look, options, etc) : M1
- come up with workflows
- Milestone 1 documents
- finish data story with other group
- visual implementation (minus "guts" - database)
	> each screen separately
- notification implementation
- connection to the map end
- coding settings (possibly the hardest task)
- getting implementation to work
- testing 
- get feedback on layouts
	> does this work well? is it well explained/obvious?
- app thumbnail
- map implementation
- design specifications for prototype (ultimately, full version)
- first prototype : M2
	> just the menu and one inscription page
- write design report

- thoughts: what is the purpose of the picture? just for location or for actually reading the inscription (in bad weather, at night, etc)
	> have a low res pic on phone for locating the picture, but have the option to request a high res photo from the server for closer examination

M1
Goal 1: Visual Design (layout of screens, notifications are higher/lower priority subgoals)
Goal 2: Specifications, User Requirements, Design Log
Goal 3: Iron out data specs and where data is stored with other group
M2
Goal 4: Working prototype (a single inscription with filler text, pop-down menu with icons that link to blank pages, button that makes a notification pop up, help page?)
M3
Goal 5: Put prototype on app store
Goal 6: Next level prototype (everything but map and search, looking exactly as we want it to look, fully connected to database, GPS notifications working)
M4
Goal 7: Fully functional launchable app, map and search implemented
Goal 8: Do a walkthrough in Sackville to test the functionality with fake data
M5
Goal 9: Fully tested with out of class test subjects
Goal 10: Final version uploaded on app store
Goal 11 (Tentative): Add additional language functionality
Goal 12 (Tentative) : Short intro tutorial


Workflow Brainstorming - develop use cases and descriptions by Monday, Jan. 26

CORINNE

- Walks by, wants to explore inscription
- walks by, doesn't to explore inscription
- walks by, wants to explore LATER
- walks by multiple inscriptions (does and doesn't want to explore)
	> explore all, explore one, explores none
- walks into an area with multiple inscriptions
- walks by inscription on a daily basis

KAREN

- want to see an inscription you've seen previously
- want to find nearest inscription (map)
- want to look at a list of inscriptions
- wants to find inscription near travel path
- wants to change notification settings
- wants to reset "seen" inscriptions
- wants to change base language
- doesn't want to see translations of inscriptions

JESSE

- needs help navigating app
- wants to find info about creaters
- ERRORS
- user gets notified but there isn't an inscription around (misnotification)
- user can't find inscription 
- user doesn't know what to search for when looking for inscription

Next meeting - Friday, Jan. 23
