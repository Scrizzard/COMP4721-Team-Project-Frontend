MEETING NOTES - JANUARY 16, 2015

DESIGN IDEAS
- different inscriptions open up in different tabs
- which notification you click on opens a specific tab
- when opening app, either open up to the new inscription you've just passed, or the last one you've visited
- have a map, be able to see possible locations highlighted
	> link to google map, potentially
	> ability to get directions to other areas
	> different colours for already visited places?
- Potential Options: help, settings, info, search? (for the future)
- emphasis on user control over their experience
	> user may specify type of notifications, how many notifications/inscriptions, within each inscription ability to get extra notifications
- on each inscription page, either have a see map option, or just the inscription info
	> potentially use Google maps for an embedded map, since it's available on most phones already
- there should be a difference between getting notified about passing an inscription and actually reading the page/visiting the site

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS/FURTHER DISCUSSION
- how do you actually make a map with things highlighted?
	> is that a data or a front end issue?
	> how do we connect from clicking on the map to a page in our app?
- multiple notifications: is there a way to delete redundant or previous notifications?
	> open to the inscription for the specific notification they've clicked on?
	> can we make a queue of notifications?
		>> open up a new tab/view every time you get a new notification
		>> one tab with "current" or closest inscription with focus (or an icon that indicates its status)
- what exactly should notifications constitute? 
			
TO DISCUSS WITH BACK-END TEAM
- data story, data structures we'll be dealing with
- what things we want to keep track of: number of notifications, change of inscription settings (max reminders, etc), 
	actually viewed notification vs. walked by but did not click notification
- set up preliminary calendar of events
- set up shared Github 
- communication scheme between groups
	> shared notes, any other ideas?
	> put meeting descriptions on communal Github
		
NEXT STEPS
- start playing around with screens
- designing help and settings pages
- look at geofencing code
- preliminary research on android app development
